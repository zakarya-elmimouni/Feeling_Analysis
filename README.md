# Feeling_Analysis
Welcome to the Feeling Analysis repository! This project focuses on building a classifier that can classify comments and feedback into two classes: 'positive' and 'negative' using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Stanford's Large Movie Review Dataset.
# Overview
In this project, we aimed to create a text classification model capable of determining the sentiment expressed in various comments and feedback. The primary goal is to categorize the text data into two classes - 'positive' and 'negative'. The model was trained on a subset of the provided dataset using NLP techniques and achieved an accuracy of 73%.
